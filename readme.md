# Fix-Lastpass

Moves the show password button on the login form so that it doesn't clash with the LastPass fill field button.

## Description

When using the LastPass browser extension to login to WordPress self-hosted sites, the LastPass fill field button is covered by the WordPress show password button making it impossible to fill the password field using LastPass. This plugin does just one thing: it moves the show password button to the left a bit so the LastPass fill field button is accessible.
